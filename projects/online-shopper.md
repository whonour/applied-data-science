This project analyzes the **UCI Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset** to predict whether a session will result in a purchase using behavioral and contextual features such as page views, bounce rate, exit rate, and special days. 

## 🔍 Goal

Help e-commerce businesses identify high-intent visitors and understand which behaviors most strongly correlate with purchase conversions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- CRISP-DM framework

## 📊 Methods

- Data cleaning & feature engineering  
- Train/test split  
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC  

## 🎯 Key Results

- **Best model:** Random Forest (highest accuracy & recall)  
- **Top features:** Page Value, Bounce Rate, Exit Rate, Special Day   
- All data anonymized, with explicit attention to privacy and fairness.
